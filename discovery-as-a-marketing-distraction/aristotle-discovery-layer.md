In the Spring 2011 work began on a forked copy of the  Django-based
[Kochief](https://code.google.com/p/kochief/) repository that eventually
became the [Aristotle Discovery Layer](https://github.com/jermnelson/Discover-Aristotle) 
that was also heavily influenced by the [Blacklight](http://projectblacklight.org/) 
project. The user interface for the Discover Layer was initially created by 
White Whale Web Services, a higher education design firm, as part of a general new
website design for the entire campus while the backend search index uses Solr, a common
implementation choice for both open-source and commercial discovery services.

In the sixteen criteria Rider University Libraries used to evaluate Discovery 
Tools, Aristotle Discovery Layer still meets at least a portion 
10/16 of the criteria including <em>State-of-the-art web interface</em>, 
<em>Enriched Content</em>, <em>Faceted navigation</em>, <em>Persistent links.</em>,
and <em>Mobile compatibility.</em>(Chickering and Yang 2014) despite not being actively 
improved since 2013.
