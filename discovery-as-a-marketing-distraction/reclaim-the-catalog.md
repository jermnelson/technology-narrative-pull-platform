Instead of just considering the library catalog primary purpose is for
patrons, librarians, and staff to access or "discovery" materials in the in the
institution's collections; it is my belief that the library catalog is the
core operational and intellectual asset of the library. With such library
luminaries as Roy Tennent calling for the demotion of the library catalog by
encouraging libraries to
"Take that anachronistic library catalog and turn it back into what it really
only ever was - an inventory control system." (Tennent 2014) or as Diane Cmor
says "Obviously, we still need  back-end catalogs (or the equivalent) to feed
our holdings into our discovery systems, but the user interface
is no longer necessary." (Cmor and Litwin 2014)  Missing from these
analysis is that even poor user interface for backend enterprise
systems, as envisioned by Tennent and Cmor, have real and significant costs
that are borne by library staff and administration. 

Organizations and other vendors offer discovery
as an added-value service, but providing easy site-maps of schema.org data for
harvest by larger commercial search engines like Google, Microsoft, and others
provide discovery and higher rankings of the library's resources through their
business models. Library technology needs to become more flexible, not less, and
we need to start being able to simplify our technology dependencies through lean
approaches.
