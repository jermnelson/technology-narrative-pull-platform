Although that might now have been the intentions of either Cmor or Litwin in
their debate on retiring the library catalog, there is another alternative to
what either of them suggest for libraries. Instead of purchasing a commercial
discovery system or deploying one of the open-source discovery layer alternatives,
libraries should consider if their rate-of-return on their technology investment
for resource discovery would be better spent through online adverting of their
collections on the major commercial general search like Google or Microsoft
Bing. This radical approach has already been investigated by libraries as 
Utrecht University Library, where their student patrons start their search 
83% of the time from a search engine with under 1% using a online databases and
the library website. (Kortekaas 2012)
