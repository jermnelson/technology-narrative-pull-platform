### MARC Batch Processing App
Like many libraries, Tutt Library's shift in collection activity from paper 
journals to electronic journals continued with more vendors and databases 
offering more online resources. One method for improving access to these 
resources, and an increasingly larger percentage of ebooks, was that the 
library was manually manipulating the MARC records provided by vendors. 
While the macro capabilities of alternatives like MARCEdit could have 
worked, we decided instead to create a web app that would allow library
staff to upload the vendor MARC record, automatically normalize the MARC
fields to the Tutt Library and Consortium standards for MARC records, and 
then download the resulting modified MARC records to the staff's local
workstation that can then be imported into the Tutt Library's legacy ILS.
