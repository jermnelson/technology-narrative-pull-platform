### Fedora Utilities App
Tutt Library's digital repository is part of the Colorado Alliance of
Research Library's consortium digital repository service that uses Islandora
and Fedora. The Fedora Utilities App provided a couple of tools for library
staff to accomplish tasks that were extremely time-consoming in the old version
of Islandora (moving an entire collection of objects from one collection to
another) or difficult (create stub records of common metadata for an entire collection
of Fedora Objects).
