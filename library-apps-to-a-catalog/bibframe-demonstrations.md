# BIBFRAME Demonstrations

Following the Modeling BIBFRAME entities in Redis that gained traction with 
the release of the formal BIBFRAME vocabulary at the first iteration of the 
<http://bibframe.org> website. In early 2013, Nelson published another Code4Lib 
article(Nelson, 2013), further describes a Redis-based bibliographic web 
applications with designs for Linked Data peer-to-peer and consortia datastores. 
At the 2013 Code4Lib conference in Chicago, Nelson co-presented on the current 
status of his collaborative work with the University of Denver in a presentation 
titled, Evolving Towards a Consortium BIBFRAME Redis Datastore, that further 
detailed a multi-institutional BIBFRAME application design. Invited to present at 
the BIBFRAME forum at annual ALA conference in the summer of 2012, we demonstrated 
a consortium BIBFRAME discovery layer and catalog that included MARC records from 
the member institutions of the Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries, all 40,000+ 
RDF/XML records from Project Gutenberg, and over 5,000 MODS records harvested from 
Colorado College's Fedora 2.7 digital repository. This demonstration system is 
publicly available at <http://tuttdemo.coloradocollege.edu/> with the open-source 
code available on Github.
