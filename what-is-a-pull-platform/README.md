# What is a Pull Platform?

In their book, *The Power of Pull*, the John Seely Brown and John Hagel III explain that the pull platforms offer a new model for "mobilizing appropriate resources when the need arises" (Hagel and Brown, 2008)

Instead of trying to predict perfectly patrons, staff, and administration's demands for information resources and services, the catalog pull platform focuses on building fast, loosely coupled networked web tools that are iteratively developed using processes and techniques from AGLE and Lean startup's ideas in Build-Measure-Learn cycles (Ries, 2011). What this means for the developing the software tools that support a Pull Platform is that sophisticated tools emerge over time starting with a Minimum Viable Product, a term popularized by the Lean Startup movement (Ries, 2011) that product is then incrementally improved with direct testing and feedback from the participants in the pull platform.

Critical to pull platforms is the idea that new ideas and experiements are encouraged with a negitiable barrier of use  negitiable for the participant and these new ideas and processes are communicated to other participants.
