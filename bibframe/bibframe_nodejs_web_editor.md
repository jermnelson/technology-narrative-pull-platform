# BIBFRAME node.js web editor

In May of 2014, the Library of Congress released a web-based editor for creating new RDF graphs of BIBFRAME entities as a Github repository at <https://github.com/lcnetdev/bfe/>. The author contributed a node.js web server that was extended so that librarians, staff, volunteers, and interested patrons could load existing or create new BIBFRAME Fedora objects.
