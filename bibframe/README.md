# BIBFRAME Linked Data Toolset

The development of the Catalog Pull Platform has closely followed the Library of Congress Bibliographic Framework (BIBFRAME) initiative. The initial 2011 announcement from the Library of Congress on the creation of a bibliographic framework began a process by which a replacement for MARC 21 format with Linked data was began. Listed among the requirements for this new framework was that the new framework, later called BIBFRAME, would first use Linked data to "Accommodation of textual data, linked data with URIs instead of text, and both." as well as provide for "Consideration of the needs of all sizes and types of libraries, from small public to large research." (BIBFRAME, 2011).

Staring in 2011 and continuing today, the author has been an early experimenter, being invited to present at an ALA 2013 round-table on BIBFRAME as well as being one of the first listings on the BIBFRAME Implementation Register. (BIBFRAME Implementation Register, 2014)
