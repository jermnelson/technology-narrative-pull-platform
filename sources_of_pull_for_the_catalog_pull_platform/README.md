# Pull Sources for the Catalog Pull Platform
People, institutions, and algorithms pull information, resources, and services out of the Catalog Pull Platform.

While it is helpful to deconstruct the pull sources for a typical library, in practice these sources have been fairly limited to academic libraries. Also, as time progresses these distinctions may become more arbitrary as both people and institutions require more and more algorithmic interfaces to fully respond to the their demands.

Focusing on the library's catalog, often the most complicated and expensive enterprise software used in the library, the catalog pull catalog augments, supersedes, or bridges semantic description of artifacts being curated and managed by the critical source of pull, people working and using the library.

The library's catalog, which used to be called the library's integrated library systems and now being marketed as "library services platform" (Breeding, 2012) touches most areas of the library's operations, collections, and public services. The functionality needed to support acquisition and circulation work-flows - not mention the increasingly complex electronic resource management for journals and e-books - traditionally requires these large software systems to include all functionality into monolithic "black-boxes". Competing on feature lists or different user interfaces to the underlying catalog, library automation vendors push features and functionality to libraries.

In the catalog pull platform, by offering loosely coupled modules for bibliographic description and operation, allows for easier assembly of new services based on the requirements and demands of the different sources of pull.
