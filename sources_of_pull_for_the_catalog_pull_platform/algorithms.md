# Algorithms
Deliberately differentiating pull sources from institutions into two parts; the more general institutional requirements from the specific requirements that software services by those institutions. For example, the importance of exposing a library's collections to Google and other search engines might be pulled from Google but as a source for algorithmic demands for their search engine harvesters.

OCLC's web services are another example of algorithmic source of pull to the Catalog Pull Platform that is distinct from the other demands that OCLC may have from the library's catalog.

[(Profit generated per year) x (years of asset operation)] - cost of building/acquiring asset.
