# People
People - patrons, librarians, staff, software developers, administration, volunteers, or the general public - are the most important pull source for the catalog pull platform. The library's patrons, divided into cohorts by characteristics, roles, or preferences, start with specific requests and requirements based on various communication channels between the network of participants within the Catalog Pull Platforms. These people's stories, their interests, and time are the precious and should not be wasted through complicated or complex web sites or obscure commands. By building tools that connect legacy and current systems with the people that need information or services now, the catalog pull platform early stages at Colorado College were creating simple, standalone web applications that connected legacy ILS MARC-based workflows with the library's discovery layer and Fedora-based institutional repository.

The Code4Lib listserv is a classic example of how decentralized problem-solving and help connects diverse participants that often have similar problems.

## Patron Relationship Management and Development
Translating John Hegel's customer relationship management (Hagel, 2012) to one that fits the library's status as a non-profit, is what I describe as patron relationship management. As part of the college,

Hagel's original Formula
[(Profit generated per year) x (years of relationship)] - cost of customer acquisition

Years of relationship varies on the patron cohort. For undergraduate students, the hope is four years but it could be for longer depending on the graduation rate. Other academic library patron cohort

What are the costs for patron acquisitions?

What does this look like for Tutt Library?
