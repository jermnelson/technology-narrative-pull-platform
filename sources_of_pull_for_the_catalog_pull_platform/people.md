### People
People - patrons, librarians, staff, software developers, administration, volunteers, or the general public - are the most important pull source for the catalog pull platform. The library's patrons, divided into cohorts by characteristics, roles, or preferences, start with specific requests and requirements that are captured through various communication channels between the network of participants within the Catalog Pull Platforms. These people's stories, their interests, and time are the precious and should not be wasted through complicated or complex web sites or obscure commands. By building tools that connect legacy and current systems with the people that need information or services now, the catalog pull platform early stages at Colorado College was about creating simple, standalone web applications that connected legacy ILS MARC-based workflows with the library's discovery layer and Fedora-based institutional repository.

The Code4Lib listserv is a classic example of how decentralized problem-solving and help connects diverse participants that often have similar problems. For a small academic library like Tutt, the catalog pull platform requirements and connects participants from the library staff as they manage the services and collections of the library.  Library information literacy instruction is one area where communication between the student and library is spread across most of the professional librarians and staff but from which ideas, observations, and suggestions for what students may require from their library.
