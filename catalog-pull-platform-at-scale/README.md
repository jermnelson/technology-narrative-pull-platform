## The Catalog Pull Platform at Scale

The Catalog Pull Platform starts with being easy for libraries to create a catalog of local resources and artifacts and connecting their patrons to regional, national and global communities.

### Current Status of Catalog Pull Platform - Producer and Consumer of Local Linked Data

In their article on library Linked Open Data in implementing systems, Rurik Greenall and Lukas Koster list three reasons why libraries may adopt Linked Open Data:
* Exposing or publishing their own data as Linked Open Data for other organizations and individuals to consume.
* Consuming and re-using Linked Open Data from external sources as a way to enrich and enhance their own data
* Using Linked Open Data for a "completely new vendor-independent, Web-based
infrastructure and workflow for cataloguing"

(Greenall, Koster 2014)

The first iteration of the TIGER catalog met the first two reasons for adopting Linked Open Data. The flexibility of the catalog pull platform allowed Tutt Library staff to begin the exploring the potential of linked data as an library operational infrastructure for collecting and managing a library's collection. The iterative nature of the catalog pull platform means that services and resources can be built out when needed by the participants of the platform and are not reliant on external vendors for new features to be "pushed" when convenient for them.

While Colorado College is the principle user of the Catalog Pull Platform, expanding its scale to other institutions and groups is being developed and coordinated through regional collaborations with other Universities, public libraries, and consortiums.

### Next Step for Catalog Pull Platform - Regional Collaboration through Shared Consortia Services

Colorado College is a member of Colorado Alliance of Research Libraries, a growing consortium of academic, public, governmental, and special libraries. CARL principle service is a union catalog, [Prospector](http://prospectorhome.coalliance.org/), as well as offering a shared digital repository service running Fedora and Islandora.

In collaboration with the Alliance and other higher education institutions, a new union catalog is being designed that uses the component pieces of the Catalog Pull Platform. Using both central and distributed semantic servers, local changes to a library's holdings will be propagated to other institutions and aggregated through a new "Prospector" Catalog.

### Future Steps for Catalog Pull Platform

To experience both primary and secondary network effects that are promises of truly effective pull platform, a team is assembled that will focus on expanding the Catalog Pull Platform to larger audiences and users. Also, an upcoming book, "Becoming a Lean Library" on using lean principles in Library, written by the author, goes into much more detail about the techniques and processes for leveraging the power of the Catalog Pull Platform in libraries. As an emerging narrative for library technology, the Catalog Pull Platform aims to accelerate the learning of its participants while offering faster and more responsive resources and services to library patrons.
