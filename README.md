A technological narrative of a catalog pull platform

Based on John Hagel III and John Seely Brown idea of a pull platform, the resources and services in the Catalog Pull Platform are directly "pulled" from the needs of staff, librarians, library administration, commercial entities, and algorithms. The purpose of the Catalog Pull Platform is to simple; creating and building ctalogs for libraries, cultural heritages institutions, and any individual or organzation intersted in long-term stewardship of collections and artifactsThe Catalog Pull Platform is a technology narrative and open source umbrella project from which specific bibliographic and operational services have been built using such vocabularies as MARC, BIBFRAME, and Schema.org.

The Catalog Pull Platform asoffers loosely coupled components for rapid, iterative, Build-Measure-Learn software development cycles for Colorado College's linked data research, experiments, and digital services. The highest profile project is a new catalog with a Fedora 4 and Flask-based semantic server made up of Colorado College's MARC records that have been converted to BIBFRAME and Schema.org linked data.
