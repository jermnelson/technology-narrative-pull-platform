# A Technological Narrative of a Library Catalog

The library's catalog, usually the core of what is called the library's integrated library 
systems and now being marketed as "library services platform" (Breeding 2012), 
touches most areas of the library's operations, collections, and public services. 
The functionality needed to support acquisition and circulation work-flows 
- not mention the increasingly complex electronic resource management for 
journals and e-books - traditionally requires these large enterprise software systems to include 
all this functionality into large monolithic "black-boxes". 
Competing on feature lists or different user interfaces to the underlying catalog, 
library automation vendors push features and functionality to libraries. 

In their book, *The Library Beyond the Book*, Schnapp and
Battles offer complying, multitudinous visions of the library that they divide
into five different scenarios; The Living Mausoleum, Neocloister, Database, 
Accumulibrary, and Programmable Library.  

How can library technology support our institutional
aspirations as we expand in new directions for collections and services?
What stories should we be able to support for our communities, institutions,
and broader access and exposure for people and algorithms beyond our
intended audiences? 

Tutt Library at Colorado College has been actively building software services
for public and internal use by librarians and staff. By building tools that 
connect legacy and current systems with the people that need information or 
services now, the library software development philosophy at Colorado College 
is about creating simple, standalone web applications that connected legacy 
ILS MARC-based workflows with the library's discovery layer and Fedora-based 
institutional repository while exploring how linked-data can be used for 
operational improvement of library services and expansion of access to the 
library's patrons. This philosophy  offers loosely coupled components for rapid,
iterative, Build-Measure-Learn software development cycles for Colorado
College's linked data research, experiments, and digital services. The
highest profile project is a new catalog with a Fedora 4 and Flask-based
semantic server made up of Colorado College's MARC records that have been
converted to BIBFRAME and Schema.org linked data.

The process of normalizing and creating conventions to support the varied
needs of a small academic library is an exciting opportunity. Given the wide
changes in how libraries need to communicate their stewardship of 
traditional and beautiful physical collections with the new mediums of
increasingly blurring
borders between the digital and physical creations, the library catalog needs to
evolve and change to meet these challenges. Libraries different social streams that expand and enhance the
